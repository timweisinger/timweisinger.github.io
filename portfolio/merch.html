                            <p>In July 2016, I found out that a new professional soccer team was launching in San Francisco, the SF Deltas.</p>
                            <p>I reached out to the team on LinkedIn and landed an interview with their Marketing Director.</p>

                            <p>During the interview, they mentioned that they were in the process of designing home kits for season ticket holders to vote on.</p>
                            <p>That night, I went home and came up with this concept.</p>

                            <p>I wanted to design something that used elements of the brand, the city, and soccer in general.</p>

                            <p>Unfortunately, my design finished in 3rd place.</p>
                            <p>However, the Deltas staff was so impressed with my initiative and creative process that they offered me a job as their Creative Content Manager.</p>
