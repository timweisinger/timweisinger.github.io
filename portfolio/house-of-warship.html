                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/houseofwarship/" target="_blank">House of Warship</a> is a Golden State Warriors fan account on Instagram that I created. The account has over 1,000 followers and has interacted with Warriors players and social media influencers including Baron Davis, Matt Barnes, and Lethal Shooter.
                    <br><br>
                    With its rituals, history, and shared experience, fandom is sometimes compared to religion because of their similarities. My goal was to create a fan account that made the Warriors feel like a religion while incorporating current events and popular culture references.
