                <h3>
                    The Town FC is a professional soccer team that is located in Moraga, California. Founded in 2021, it is the San Jose Earthquakes reserve team and participates in MLS Next Pro.
                    <br><br>
                    My goal was to create a standardized brand style guide and build excitement for the inaugural season with engaging matchday graphics. I also wanted to help build up the personal brands of the young players, who may eventually be called up to the Earthquakes first team.
