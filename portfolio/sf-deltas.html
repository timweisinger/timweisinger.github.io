                    The San Francisco Deltas were a professional soccer team based in San Francisco, California. Founded in 2016, the team made its debut in the North American Soccer League in 2017. In its only year of play, they won the 2017 NASL championship.

                    My goal was to build fan excitement for the inaugural season. As the Creative Content Manager, I was tasked with creating all marketing materials, including digital ads, MUNI bus, and TV commercials.
